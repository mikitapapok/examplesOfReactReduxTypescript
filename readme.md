#TodoList Project
This is a simple project I have made to figure out how the Redux Thunk works.
##Tools and Libraries
 In this project I used next tools and libraries:<br/>
    - React.<br/>
    - Redux.<br/>
    - ReduxToolKit.<br/>
    - SASS extension.<br/>
    - TypeScript. <br/>
##Usage
    You can create your own todo item adding text into input element.
    Also, you can get todo list from server, clicking 'get data from derver'
    button. Todo list component you are able to delete, or change its status
    clicking checkbox.
