# TodoList Project
This is a simple project I have made to figure out how the Redux Thunk works.
## Tools and Libraries
 In this project I used next tools and libraries:<br/>
    - React.<br/>
    - Redux.<br/>
    - ReduxToolKit.<br/>
    - SASS extension.<br/>
    - TypeScript. <br/>
## Usage
    You can create your own  todo item adding a text into an input element.
    Also, you can get a todo list from server clicking 'get data from server'
    button.  You are able to delete  a component or change its status
    clicking  a checkbox.
